                        Hello World,
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-justify text-md mt-4">
                        I'm Larissa Guilherme, a passionate and dedicated Frontend Software Engineer based in Roswell, Georgia.
                    </p>
                    <p className="my-3 p-4 text-lg text-right text-secondary-light">With a Full Stack Web Development certification from Georgia Tech,

                        By day, I‚Äôm a CSR Analyst and Underwriter at G Squared Funding, LLC, where I‚Äôve developed our load board app and given our website a full makeover‚Äîall while juggling my other responsibilities. Our company doesn't have an IT department, so I took on both projects from mock-up to completion all by myself. Some might call it crazy, but I love coding, and these projects were just fun side gigs.
                    </p>
                    <p className="my-3 p-4 text-lg text-right text-secondary-light">
                        It‚Äôs definitely challenging to switch between such different roles during my 8 work hours, and it makes me wonder how much more I could accomplish if I could focus solely on coding 40 hours a week.

                    <p className="text-justify text-md my-2">
                        By night, you may find me experimenting with JavaScript and React, crafting quirky web projects that blend creativity and functionality. Or maybe just doing some puzzles, playing Wordle, being extra competitive on Stop, or watching a random documentary about space or anything related to science. Yeah, I'm a big nerd. But what can I do? I just love learning new stuff ü§ì

                        I‚Äôm not just about coding, though. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Clinical Nutrition, proving I can not only debug your app but also suggest a healthy snack while doing it! Or I might invite you to go for a run ‚ÄîI‚Äôm an ex-sedentary person preparing to run a half-marathon. Oh, and I‚Äôm also a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)¬Æ, which brings a touch of order to the world of development.

                        Collaboration is my jam. I love bouncing ideas off fellow tech and non-tech enthusiasts and turning wild ideas into polished products. Recognized for my top-notch performance and innovative solutions, I‚Äôm ready to dive into new challenges with a smile and a keyboard at the ready.                    </p>
