                    <p className="text-justify text-md mt-4">
                        My coding journey began with a profound passion for problem-solving and a love for creating meaningful solutions.
                        It all started when I noticed a critical need at my current workplace. As a small company without an IT department, there was no avenue to share my ideas for enhancing our website.
                        Our website was in dire need of improvement to attract more clients and drive business growth. I firmly believed that by enhancing both the design and functionality of our website, we could make a substantial difference in our company's success.
                        This realization ignited my determination to embark on a coding adventure, seeking to equip myself with the skills necessary to bring these improvements to life.

                    <p className="my-3 p-4 text-lg text-right text-secondary-light font-bold">If you desire change, you have two options:
                        <span className="font-normal"> pursue the individuals capable of effecting it or acquire the necessary tools to instigate the change independently.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-justify text-md my-2">
                        Initially, I attempted to teach myself coding, but the sheer variety of languages, frameworks, and tools left me feeling overwhelmed.
                        A friend introduced me to HTML and CSS, but due to our schedule constraints, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp for more structured guidance.
                        From the very beginning, I was captivated by the world of coding, and each moment of learning felt like an exciting journey.

                        What started as an experiment quickly became a passion.

                        In just one month, I was completely hooked.
                        This prompted me to pursue a professional certificate in the field, driven by the desire to expand my knowledge and transform my passion into a fulfilling career.

                    <p className="text-justify text-md my-2">
                        Currently, I'm dedicated to enhancing our company's website, the very project that ignited my career transition.
